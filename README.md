# Eat Smart AI Plans (NutriPlan)

**Eat Smart AI Plans** is an intelligent web application designed to generate personalized meal plans based on individual user data. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, the system calculates precise nutritional requirements and recommends meals that align with the user's health goals, dietary preferences, and restrictions.
