                We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the app, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when you participate in activities on the app or otherwise when you contact us.

We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations.
              </p>
