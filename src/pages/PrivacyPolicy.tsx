                Welcome to NutriGuide AI. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at privacy@nutriguide.ai.
              </p>

              <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
              <p>
                We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the app, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, when you participate in activities on the app or otherwise when you contact us.
              </p>
              <p>
                The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the app, the choices you make and the products and features you use.

                We use personal information collected via our app for a variety of business purposes described below. We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>To facilitate account creation and logon process.</li>
                <li>To send you marketing and promotional communications.</li>
                <li>To send administrative information to you.</li>

              <h2>4. Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?</h2>

              <h2>5. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>

              <h2>6. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>

                We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
